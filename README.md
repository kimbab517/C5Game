# Connected-5-Game
The original name of this game is called 오목, a Korean board game. The motive of this board game is to connect 5 beads together in a linear line (whether it is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). The game consists of only 2 players trying to outcomepete eachother to connect 5 beads first.

This simple korean board game gave me a project idea to simulate the board game using a python graphics module. This project was for me to also practice implementing classes into my code (game.py is where i did all of that).
